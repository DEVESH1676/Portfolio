/* Got it! Here‚Äôs the concise explanation for the approach you‚Äôre using in the `ContactSection`:

### **Concept / Approach in a Few Words**

1. **Tailwind for layout and spacing**

   * We‚Äôre using Tailwind classes for grids, padding, typography, rounded corners, shadows, and hover effects.

2. **Tailwind colors with opacity for quick theming**

   * Example: `bg-secondary/40` ‚Üí uses the `secondary` color from Tailwind with 40% opacity.
   * This allows easy background changes without touching CSS variables.

3. **Motion / animations**

   * `framer-motion` is used for fade-in-up effects (`fadeInUp` variant) when the section scrolls into view.

4. **Form handling in React**

   * Standard `onSubmit` handler with `FormData` to collect form inputs.
   * Opens the default email client via `mailto:` link with prefilled subject and body.

5. **Icon mapping**

   * We map the string keys from `CONTACT_LINKS` to icon components from `lucide-react` dynamically.

6. **Lightweight and maintainable**

   * No hardcoded CSS colors for everything, but still themeable via Tailwind‚Äôs color system.
   * Easy to change a background color or primary color quickly using Tailwind classes.

üí° **In essence:**

> Tailwind handles **layout, spacing, typography, colors**, `framer-motion` handles **animation**, and React handles **form logic**. Colors are mostly Tailwind-based for **quick changes**, keeping the design **flexible but simple**.

If you want, I can also make a **one-line ‚Äúcheat comment‚Äù** to paste at the top of this file so you instantly remember this approach whenever you revisit it.

Do you want me to do that?
